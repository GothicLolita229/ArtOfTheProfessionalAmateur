			<h3 class="author">by Gachelle</h3>
			
			<p>Sometimes we put a mask on<br>
			To try and hide our emotions<br>
			Because if we take it off<br>
			We might drown in the oceans<br>
            Of tears that we've been holding back<br>
            "Just let me keep my mask on<br>
            I promise it's better for everyone that I stay hidden in black"</p>

            <p>
                A bed never looked so good before<br>
                You're tired, you're tired<br>
                But you don't want to sleep anymore<br>
                You hate the quiet<br>
                Your demons have got you terrorized<br>
                You scream into your hands<br>
                Your eyes stare back at me, red and teary every single night<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                "I just want it all to end<br>
                I just want it all to end<br>
                I wish I never had to breathe again<br>
                I wish I couldn't hear the voices in my head"<br>
                You just have to keep on going<br>
                It's really hard but I promise it will all be alright<br>
                I promise it will be just fine<br>
                I'm crying out to you, please don't die
            </p>

            <p>
                Your phone screen is broken in multiple places<br>
                I don't have to wonder why<br>
                You're just sick of seeing the faces<br>
                They stare back at you like you don't deserve to be alive<br>
                They stare back at you like you deserve to die<br>
                "Just let me keep my mask on<br>
                I don't want them to see that they made me cry"
            </p>

            <p>
                "I just want it all to end<br>
                I just want it all to end<br>
                I wish I never had to breathe again<br>
                I wish I couldn't hear the voices in my head"<br>
                You just have to keep on going<br>
                It's really hard but I promise it will be alright<br>
                I promise it will be just fine<br>
                I'm crying out to you, please don't die
            </p>

            <p>
                I know you just want to step off the edge<br>
                I know you're feeling dead inside and you wish it was outside<br>
                I know you just want to let everything end<br>
                Just let me be selfish and let me make you stay alive
            </p>

            <p>
                "I just want it all to end<br>
                I just want it all to end<br>
                I wish I never had to breathe again<br>
                I wish I couldn't hear the voices in my head"<br>
                You just have to keep on going<br>
                It's really hard but I promise it will be alright<br>
                I promise it will be just fine<br>
                I'm crying out to you, please don't die
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm crying out to you<br>
                Don't tear yourself out of my life<br>
            </p>
